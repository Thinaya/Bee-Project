        <h3><b>WORKER BEES</b><br>Worker bees are female, they accomplish every chore unrealates to reproduction (Which the queen bee does). In their first days, workers tend to the queen.They live for a short life (a month) but keep busy.</h3>

        <h3><b>DRONE BEES</b><br>A drone is a male that comes from an unfertilized egg. Drones canot defind the hive or collect pollen and nectar because they don't have the right body parts, so they dont contribute in the feeding community.</h3>
